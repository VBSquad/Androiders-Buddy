# The Project :open_file_folder:

  

The project is like your very own repository where you can add android studio app projects for the below mentioned topics. The project is divided into **two parts** -

  

1. UI, the XML part/Widgets

2. Java coding

Further we will have topics which will make you connect your XML with the Java code. We will be covering almost all the concepts of Android development which a newbie must learn. These topics will act as the building-blocks By customizing and assembling these blocks, you will then be able to create your own app with all the necessary elements in it.

  

We will then be reviewing and adding your project apps under the respective topic folder.

  
# How to Contribute? :thinking:

- First of all you've to comment down on the issue which you want to do. We will then assignee you that issue/project. Then you have to create an app in which you implement that particular Android topic. Don't just randomly send in your PR we need to follow some basic rules of open source. Although you can create some relevant issues of some good Android topics on which you would like to work or would want to see in the repository ( don't forget to follow the issue template ).

- Secondly then you don't have to upload your entire app which you have created earlier, you have to create a folder in which you add the .java file, the .XML file and the screenshot of the visible working output of the app and then commit and push this folder to the 'UI XML' or 'Java' folder of the repository depending on the topic. Name this folder same as the topic name. After doing so create a PR and follow the PR template.

# Contribution best practices :white_check_mark:

  

## For First time Contributors

Kindly read the [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/VBSquad/Androiders-Buddy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file first to know some basic git commands and the proper way to create issue and send pull requests.

  

## Branch Policy

To make things easy for all of us we are as of now having only one branch that is the ***master branch*** hence you need to make pull request to the master branch only.

  

## Code Practices

'With good code practices come efficiency' hence we would like you to follow some code practices -

  

- Try making single commit per pull request,

- Try using decent commit messages by following the COMMITSTYLE convention.

- If the PR is related to any front end UI, please attach relevant screenshots in the pull request description.

- Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.

  

Please help us follow the best practices to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor.
